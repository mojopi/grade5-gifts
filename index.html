            <h1>Gifts for People We Care About</h1>
            <p>These drawings are made by young people in fifth grade. They're for family and friends  they love but can't necessarily see for the holidays due to  the pandemic.<br>

               Click on the images and you'll get to to a new page. If you click there, you can hear messages for the gifts' recipients. Enjoy:)</p>
